State-owned public transportation operator PT Damri has prepared 12 buses to serve passengers using Yogyakarta International Airport (YIA) in Kulon Progo regency, Yogyakarta.
According to kompas.com, the bus service would employ three types of vehicles, namely five medium-long buses, two medium buses and five Hiace vans.
The bus operator currently serves four routes from the airport to Stasiun Wojo in Purworejo regency, Yogyakarta, Kebumen and Magelang.
The YIA-Stasiun Wojo bus service is priced at Rp 10,000 (less than US$1) per person. Meanwhile, the YIA-Yogyakarta route costs Rp 40,000 per person,
As for YIA-Kebumen and YIA-Magelang routes, the bus fare is Rp 50,000 each passenger.
Rahmat Santoso, general manager of Damri in Yogyakarta, said the services can accommodate up to 316 passengers per day.
In regard to extra flights, he mentioned that Damri Yogyakarta hascoordinated with state-owned airport operator PT Angkasa Pura I and that the 12 buses are adequate to accommodate the flights' passengers.
�We will coordinate [with PT Angkasa Pura I if additional services are needed, said Rahmat.
He said that the buses would operate without a set minimum number of passengers.
�[Yesterday], there were three passengers going to Yogyakarta. We [operated] the bus because its our job, said Rahmat, welcoming those who wanted to use Damri services from Kulon Progo airport.
�We provide direct services to Yogyakarta, Kebumen and Magelang, he added.
Tangerang City Transportation Agency head Syaiful Rohman says it plans to consolidate the Trans Kota Tangerang city bus services under the management of city-owned company PT Tangerang Nusantara Global (TNG).
Currently, 18 of the 20 Trans Kota buses are owned by various operators, while only two are managed by the Tangerang city administration. The two buses under the city administration ply the routes between Poris Plawad and Jatiuwung (corridor 1) as well as between Poris Plawad and Cibodas (corridor 2).
Syaiful said he expected the handover of Trans Kota management to make the service more professional, such as the Jakarta-owned PT Transjakarta service.
�The handover is intended to ease bureaucracy and to make the buses operation more professional, like Transjakarta,� Rohman said on Tuesday,�kompas.comreported.
He said city-owned companies would find it easier than private operators to establish corporation with other parties and to procure buses.
Rohman added that the administration was currently drafting a mayoral decree to give PT TNG the authority to run Trans Kota.
Currently, TNG is tasked with managing parking spaces, building public facilities and communication facilities in Tangerang.
�The mayor wants [the handover] to take place soon, so that public services can improve,� Rohman said. (ami)
